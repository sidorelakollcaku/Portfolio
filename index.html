                      degree on Information Technology and Bussines Management.Right now I'm participating on a course with the purpose of being a developer.</p>
                    <p> I live alone and I've been indipendent for about 6 years now.I love to travel , visit new places and take a lot of pictures so I can have it as a memory.
                      Being indipendent is not easy, you have to do everything on your own.After every struggle there is a success .I'm on my way of being succeful, and what do I mean by that?</p>
                    <p>To build my carier on the way I want it , to be a bussines wamen and having a beautiful family.I go by baby steps because I know that those are the most secure once .This is me ,
                    not very good on words but with a clear vision</p>
